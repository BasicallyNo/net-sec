# Module 1 - 4: Securing Networks
## 1. Network Topologies
#### Campus Area Networks
The main focus of this course is on securing Campus Area Networks (CANs). Campus Area Networks consists of interconnected LANs within a limited geographic area. Connections to untrusted networks must be checked in-depth by multiple layers of defense before reaching enterprise resources. This is known as defense-in-depth.

Useful technologies for providing Campus Area Network (CAN) defence:
- VPN
Virtual Private Networks are seperate from the internet and are a means of providing data confidentiality and integrity from authenticated sources.
